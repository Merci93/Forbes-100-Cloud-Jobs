Instructions on how to create one attached in PDF.

The following need to be installed:

1. Python version 3.0 and above (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) or Anaconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)

2. After installations: Open the command prompt or anaconda powershell prompt and install the following:
	a. requests: use pip install requests
	b. bs4: use pip install bs4
	c. selenium: use pip install selenium
	d. pyairtable: use pip install pyairtable

3. Extract the file in desktop.
4. Navigate to the file using the anaconda powershell or command prompt: cd .\Desktop\Cloud_100_Scrape
5. Execute the run script: python .\run.py to do all scrape, and upload data to Airtable.

WARNING: Before performing action 5, ensure to have manually deleted all data in the airtable. It is way easier
and faster than using the programmatic approach.
